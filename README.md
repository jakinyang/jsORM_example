## Introduction
This repo has branches for each method of interacting with the database: one with the node-postgres client and two with ORM libraries. Checkout (git checkout \<branchname\>) to see the code with that method.

The main branch has a basic version of the node-postgres method and the schema/seedfiles as well as a test example query in db/queries/exampleQuery.js.
